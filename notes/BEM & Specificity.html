<!-- BEM -Block Element Modifier -->

<!-- Create a scope for things -->
<!-- everything that is in tags will have the tag class prefix -->

<!-- BEM naming convention -->

<li class="pattern__title"></li>
<li class="pattern__text"></li>

<li class="pattern__wide"></li>
<!-- flex basis and width to 100% -->

<article class="card card--featured">
    <header class="card__header">
        <h3 class="card__title"></h3>

<!-- Double underscore __ = block > element link -->
<!-- Double hyphen -- = element > state -->

<!-- Makes decendency easier as they all have the same weight (same class) --> */


/* AFTERNOON NOTES */

/* div class=container - header */
/* main class=container - main content */
/* div class=container - footer */

/* add code to pattern library so you can drag and select it */


            /* CSS Specificity */

/* CSS cascades, so any styles at the top will be overwritten by those that come later*/

/* Always put custom CSS after bootstrap imports, because you may want to edit them */

/* Class is weaker than ID, ID properties are prioritised over classes */

/* (.tags .tag more specific than any tag that exists on the page */

/* Specificity Calculator tells you who wins */

/* !important - used by bootstrap and other frameworks, which overrides anything regardless of specificity */

/* Avoid inline styles and styles in the head as they have new specificity */

/* BEM and flat level class naming avoids this problem */
