When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:

sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css

Check if it installed correctly:
sass --version

More information
sass --help

Install Sass:
npm install -g sass


Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.
