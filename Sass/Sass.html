    When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile..sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:

    sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css

    Check if it installed correctly:
    sass --version

    More information
    sass --help

    Install Sass:
    npm install -g sass


    Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.

    You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. 
    For example, running 
    
    sass input.scss output.css 
    
    from your terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to 
    output.css.

    You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:

    sass --watch input.scss output.css

    You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:

    sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets

    Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.

    SCSS SYNTAX

    $font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
    $primary-color: #333;

    body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
    }

    When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.

    SCSS SYNTAX
    nav {
    ul {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        list-style: none;
    }

    li { display: inline-block; }

    a {
        display: block;
        padding: 6px 12px;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
    }

    You can nest CSS syntax like HTML.

    Partials

    You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like: 
    
    _partial.scss
    
    The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use rule.


    MODULES 

    @use 'base';

    .inverse {
    background-color: base.$primary-color;
    color: white;
    }
    
    Notice we're using @use 'base'; in the styles.scss file. When you use a file you don't need to include the file extension. Sass is smart and will figure it out for you.


    INHERITANCE

    %message-shared {
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
        padding: 10px;
        color: #333;
    }

    .message {
        @extend %message-shared;
    }

    .success {
    @extend %message-shared;
        border-color: green;
    }

    .error {
    @extend %message-shared;
        border-color: red;
    }

    .warning {
    @extend %message-shared;
        border-color: yellow;
    }

    What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and .warning to behave just like %message-shared. That means anywhere that %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, & .warning will too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where each of these classes will get the same CSS properties as %message-shared. This helps you avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML elements.

        float: right;
        width: 300px / 960px * 100%;
    }
