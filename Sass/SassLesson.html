<!-- Sass Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets -->

<!-- 
    A preprocessor for CSS.
    Gives us extra syntax to allow us to write less CSS.
    Have the Sass engine process it, and write CSS.

    Lunar Home Site is written in native CSS to be super lightweight and not have any CSS that isn't being used.

    In CodePen you can go to Settings, CSS and choose SCSS preprocessor.

    PostCSS is another preprocessor, can be combined with SASS.

 -->

 <!-- VARIABLES -->
 <!-- 

    ===

     $gridCols: 7;

     grid-template-columns: repeat($gridCols, 1fr);

     Because Sass is a preprocessor, they're replaced in the actual style sheet with their actual values. Hence there's no browser compatibility issues.

    ===

    $grid: (
        Cols: 7,
        ColSize: 1fr
    );

    grid-template-columns: repeat(map-get($grid, cols), map-get($grid, colSize));

    Maps are a good way of structuring related data.

    
    ===

    $breakpoints: 468px, 768px, 992px, 1200px;
    
    Creates an array ^ 

    max-width: nth($breakpoints, 2);
    This takes the second entry of $breakpoints;

  <!-- NESTING & PARENT SELECTOR OPERATOR -->
  <!-- 

      You can nest CSS stuff

      .grid {
          .grid__cell {

          }
      }

      This is the same as:

      .grid .grid__cell {

      }

      .grid {
          &__cell {
            &__text {

            }
          }
        }

      The & stands in for the parent class name here. Great for typing out BEM.

      .grid {
          &__cell {
              &:nth-of-type(1){

              }
          }
        }
   -->

   <!-- MIXIN -->
    <!-- 

        @mixin gridArea($colStart, $colEnd, $rowStart, $rowEnd){
            grid-column: #{$colStart} / #{$colEnd};
            grid-row: #{$rowStart} / #{$rowEnd};
        }
        
        These variables are scoped only to the gridArea mixin.
        #{} interpolation, tells Sass to just insert something, not perform any Sass functionality on it.
        In the above example, it would do maths division if we didn't do this.
        
        .grid {
          &__cell {
              &:nth-of-type(1){
                  @include gridArea(2, 3, 1, 2);
              }
          }
        }

        Another Example

        @mixin cellOverlay($leftPos: 0, $backgroundColor: Orange){
            $leftPos = 1rem;
            $backgroundColor = Orange;
        }

        .grid {
          &__cell {
              &:nth-of-type(1){
                  @include cellOverlay();
              }
          }
        }

        Default values for arguments can be set as above example, where no arguments are passed, so it is just given 1rem and Orange.

        Another Example

        @mixin cellOverlay($leftOrRight: 'left', $width: 100%){
            #{$leftOrRight} = 0;
            width = $width;
        }

        .grid {
          &__cell {
              &:nth-of-type(1){
                  @include cellOverlay('right', 25%);
              }
          }
        }

        ^ Would set the right to have a width of 25%.

    <!-- Partials -->
    <!-- 
        The reason why we separate components out is because of sass.
        Sass imports are all done before the website loads, unlike css imports which make separate network requests for each.
     -->

     <!-- Functions -->
     <!-- 
         You can use functions, to even make like, pixels to Rem functions.
      -->

      <!-- Conditionals -->
      <!-- 
          
          @if ($color) {
              color: $color;
          }

       -->
