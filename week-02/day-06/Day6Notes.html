<!-- Design System & Pattern Libraries -->


<!-- Collating designs and patterns within a site -->
<!-- color system / repeatable patterns -->
<!-- Having a link that's used in multiple places -->
<!-- Figma using a 'blog card' that can be used multiple times/places -->
<!-- IBM design system -->
<!-- Pattern library - single source of truth -->
<!-- Mailchimp Content Style Guide (for reference) -->


<!-- Pattern Library -->
<!-- Make all the prototype parts of the site so they're standardised across the board -->
<!-- devs all contribute to this pattern library before the page is built at all -->

<!-- button - want to think about the various roles a button could have -->

<p>These buttons will be the main call to action that is used on the site.</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary">Button Primary</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Button Secondary</button>

<p>The main input on the form.</p>
<input type="text" class="form-input">

<style>
    /* default class */
    .btn {

    }

    /* different placing of button */
    .btn-primary{

    }

    /* different placing of button */
    .btn-secondary{

    }

    /* You also want to have a library for button states too */
    .btn:hover {

    }

    .form-input {

    }
</style>

<!-- You now don't need to think about any additional states the button needs to be in, this should be contained within the design system -->

<!-- The most efficient way to build large-scale applications is using libraries like this -->

<!-- TOOLS -->
<!-- Storybook.js.org -->

<!-- Atomic Design -->
<!-- Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages -->
<!-- Atoms - single input, paragraph, button on its own -->
<!-- Molecules - combine atoms and make them into more useful compound components 
    eg. input + a button -->
<!-- Organisms - Logo, navigation + call to action section -->
<!-- Templates - made up of organisms, so it's modular and easily editable -->

<!-- Use Includes to include the above elements -->



<!-- Dealing with the client's design -->
<!-- Might have to question accessibility and performance of client's design -->
<!-- Handover questions - need to do lots of questions on the designs you receive or you'll get lots of problems later -->


<!-- USING FIGMA -->
<!-- You can get the hex color from Figma on the right hand side -->
<!-- Double Click images - Export Type (use Jpeg) then export -->
<!-- Icons use png or svg -->

<!-- svg is the lightest format -->
<!-- SVG is just code and has to be dropped into your code -->
<!-- SVG is quicker to load - painting to the page -->

<!-- When approaching the problem, think about how you're going to approach it initially. Flex or Grid? etc. -->
<!-- Think about namiing to - Hero -->

<!-- Blueprinting -->
<!-- Naming conventions, dimensions etc. -->


<!-- PROJECT GUIDE -->
<!-- assets
        -icons - fonts- images 
        -CSS main.css card.sss + import-->
<!-- pages as individual html files -->
<!-- pattern library as only html file -->

<!-- pattern library skeleton -->
<!-- logo nav -->
<!-- each individual resuable part of the library should be in pattern library -->
<!-- ONLY REUSABLE STUFF -->
