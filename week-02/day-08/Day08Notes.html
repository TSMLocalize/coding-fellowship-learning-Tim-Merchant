<!-- TESTING -->

    <!-- automated, manual -->
    <!-- crossbrowsertesting -->

    <!-- BrowserStack - for cross browser testing -->
    <!-- Lets you check stuff on different devices -->
    <!-- You can also test in development tools -->

    <!-- Caniuse.com check whether it's supported -->
    <!-- Grid came out in 2013, sometimes you need prefixes to support it on old stuff (check caniuse) -->

    <!-- autoprefixer - can add all your prefixes for you -->
    <!-- NPM package autoprefixer which will prefix everything automatically for you -->

    <!-- Modernizr - feature detection -->
    <!-- Browsers have a 'user agent' you visit a website, the user agent tells you abotu the device being used to access -->
    <!-- Modernizr adds classes to the body -->

    <!-- @supports - not well supported yet, but becoming prominent -->


    <!-- team will sit down, check google analytics, check what level of support we're using for our browsers -->

    <style>
        @supports (display: grid) {
            .gallery {
                display: grid;
            }
        }
    </style>

    <!-- Ask others to check the code on github after you've done crossbrowser testing, and then they will also do cross browser testing too -->
    <!-- They will point out bugs and show the code that it most likely refers to -->

    <!-- polyfills -->
    <!-- You can use sudo, javascript, and npm to import packages and get unsupported stuff to be supported-->

    <!-- cy-test -->
    <!-- acts as a user on the site for you -->
    <!-- checks whether stuff works -->

    <!-- You can use the network tab to throttle your connection and check how fast stuff will load on, like, 3G etc. -->

    <!-- Try supporting IE 11 on the project! -->
    <!-- Validate cde in W3C validator -->


<!-- WEB ACCESSIBILITY -->

    <!-- All of these things should be in the style guide at the beginning -->
    
    <!-- It's best to build accessibility at the VERY START of the project -->
    <!-- Easily click-able buttons -->
    <!-- Decent Font-size -->
    
    <!-- public websites need to meet same standard as gov.uk website -->
    <!-- all about making things inclusive for absolutely everybody -->
    <!-- A AA AAA levels of accessibility -->
    <!-- Vision Australia - meets AAA standards -->
    <!-- You have to meet certain criteria to make it accessible to a wide array of users -->
    
    <!-- Think about sight, hearing impaired, hand impaired (no mouse), color blindness -->
    
    <!-- Increasing accessibility = larger userbase for the company -->
    
    <!-- Public websites need to meet the AA standard or users can sue them -->
    
    <!-- W3 How to Meet WCAG -->
    
    <!-- LIGHTHOUSE - part of chrone development tools 
    
        Audits site, generates report about accessibility to 100%
    -->

    <!-- Make sure to have the right semantic html tags for the sake of screen readers -->

    <!-- Vimium - adds key aliases for everything on the site -->

    <!-- Spectrum - Google Chrome, tests website for different color blindness -->

    <!-- ARIA -->
    <!-- 
        aria-controls="success-message"
        aria-controlledby="btn"

        Tells a screen reader which thing a button controls

        Used for describing relationships between elements

        aria-hidden="true"
        only sends the message to the screen reader after the event (when true)

    -->
    <style>
        .success[aria-hidden="false"] {
            opacity: 1;
        }
    </style>
