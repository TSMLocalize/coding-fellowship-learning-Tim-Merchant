use p tags for text
use images, not background images
alt tag = just needs 'dog' not 'picture of dog'
ES Lint rules?

If it goes somewhere, use an <a>
If it actions something on the page, just a <button>

What is SEO?

Use Proper Input type.

If you were to strip grid/flex off the page, the content should still be readable.

USE CLEAN HTML - use verifier

Cloudinary? upload image and get alt tags back

ARIA dash rolls (use ARIA roles as selectors in CSS?)


WAVE -> Lighthouse

Multiple navigation elements on one page can be differentiated with ARIA labels.
