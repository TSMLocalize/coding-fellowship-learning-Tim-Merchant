    Coming to coding from a game development/hobby angle, I've found it interesting 
    to learn about the actual business of web development- how websites are structured, how they're designed, thinking about user experience and the business angle.
    
    I'm not sure as I enjoy the design angle right now, and would prefer to get involved in something a bit more coding/technically heavy eventually.
    
    This week I've enjoyed learning about CSS grid and flexbox. The zombies game was useful for flexbox, and I get grid in theory, though it's often difficult to remember how to use it in practice-something I will doubtless have to look up each time in future.

    I've been continuing to revise Javascript in my spare time, and thinking of starting a passion project this weekend.

    I feel I've gained more confidence in laying out a website now, particularly with grid and flex.

    I've gained an understanding of testing and accessibility, although testing is something I'm still not entirely sure about (as it broke my project when I used the validator). I'll chalk this up to things that I should learn better on the job, though I do feel I've gained some new ideas about best practice.

    I still don't feel confident whether I'm able to satisfactorily design a website to the brief, even though I had some success with the week's project. In fact, this week has been great for boosting my confidence in being able to create a whole project and not just fiddle around with bits of unrelated html and css.

    We've started learning Sass which I found really interesting. It's great to be able to finally use the terminal and install a package etc.

    I played around with Sass inheritance, variables etc. Still have much more to learn with this though.

    I've been impressed with emmet commands and their versatility, going to make a point to learn these thoroughly I think.

    Learning BEM and how to structure classes has been particularly good in anchoring my understanding of overall in terms of how to approach the structuring of a large project.
