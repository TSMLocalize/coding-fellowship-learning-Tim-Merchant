    Entry 1
    
    Coming to coding from a game development/hobby angle, I've found it interesting 
    to learn about the actual business of web development- how websites are structured, how they're designed, thinking about user experience and the business angle.
    
    I'm not sure as I enjoy the design angle right now, and would prefer to get involved in something a bit more coding/technically heavy eventually.
    
    This week I've enjoyed learning about CSS grid and flexbox. The zombies game was useful for flexbox, and I get grid in theory, though it's often difficult to remember how to use it in practice-something I will doubtless have to look up each time in future.

    I've been continuing to revise Javascript in my spare time, and thinking of starting a passion project this weekend.
